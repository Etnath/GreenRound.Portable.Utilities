# GreenRound Portable Utilities
GreenRound Portable Utilities is a portable class utility that have the following targets :

* .Net 4.5
* Windows 8
* Windows phone 8
* Windows phone 8.1
* Xamarin.Android
* Xamarin.iOS

GreenRound Portable Utilities aims are to :

* Bring back some functionalities that were in the .Net framework but were removed from the .NET portable framework. Obviously some features such as IO operations are platform specific. In these cases the library will only provides abstract base class or interface.
* Add functionalities that are used in most applications such as logging or monitoring
* Add various helpers and design patterns to help developers produce clearer code.  

### Current Status

This library is in pre-release for the following reasons:

* A lot of planned functionalities are missing
* It is in early development so namespace and design may change between versions. Compatibility between versions is currently not guaranteed.
