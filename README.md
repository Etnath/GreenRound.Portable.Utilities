* .Net 4.5

GreenRound Portable Utilities aims are to :

* Add various helpers and design patterns to help developers produce clearer code.  

### Current Status

This library is in pre-release for the following reasons:

* It is in early development so namespace and design may change between versions. Compatibility between versions is currently not guaranteed.
